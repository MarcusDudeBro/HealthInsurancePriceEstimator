# Health Insurance Price Estimator
A simple python program that uses information about you (i.e. age, sex, bmi...) to estimate medical costs billed by your health insurance

### About
To make an estimation, the program takes in your information, and inputs it into an equation. Weights of said equation were determined through
machine learning methods. In order to train the model to find the corresponding weights, I used a dataset I found on the kaggle website.\
